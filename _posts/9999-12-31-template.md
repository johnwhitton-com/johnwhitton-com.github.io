## Solution/Use Case Overview

## Use Cases this can be applied to

## Closing Remark 

Many technical problems mentioned here warrant a standalone deep-dive article for further discussion (and their relevance to ZKP). We will also write separate articles to discuss the approaches and algorithms we propose to make the trustless bridge work using ZKP and how we solve immediate problems today. If you are interested in working with us, please let us know at [hello@isolab.gg](mailto: hello@isolab.gg)
