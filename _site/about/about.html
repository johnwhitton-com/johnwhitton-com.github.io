        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p><img src="./../assets/images/JohnWhittonWorkHistory.png" alt="John Whitton Work History" title="John Whitton Work History" /></p>

<p>I am currently working as an Engineering Manager at <a href="https://eco.com">Eco</a> building a payment focused intent protocol on a dedicated L3 rollup.</p>

<p>Previous work includes researching zero knowledge proofs, cryptographic primitives and consensus protocols. I also consult as a research engineer providing strategy, research, design and building out DeFi infrastructure including trustless bridging, web3 identity and wallets. Deployments have been on EVM compatible chains including <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/">Ethereum</a> and <a href="https://www.harmony.one/">Harmony</a>.</p>

<p>I prototyped the DEX <a href="https://github.com/kangafinance">Kanga Finance</a> (inspired by <a href="https://github.com/sushiswap">Sushi</a>) and a DeFi parachain <a href="https://github.com/eavenetwork">eave.network</a> (inspired by <a href="https://github.com/acalanetwork">Acala</a>). Deployments on <a href="https://www.harmony.one/">Harmony</a> and <a href="https://polkadot.network/">Polkadot</a>. As founder for these projects, I was responsible for writing whitepapers, reviewing legal infrastructure, and fundraising. Although projects had investor interest and were awarded <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ZGrbKSaAdtzvMzVh0EVFBfUvA4SqiAeYVXGhJN7Orbs/edit#slide=id.g48989ac23a_0_0">hackathon prizes</a> the projects did not move forward due to a combination of team commitment, market fit and crypto market conditions.</p>

<p>Previously I was as an Ecosystem Architect at Harmony. Where I helped launch the Harmony Mainnet, grew the ecosystem and was also intimately involved with hiring decisions and business strategy. Prior to this I was CTO for Loyyal (BaaS company) where we built private permissioned blockchains on Ethereum and Hypersphere Fabric and I managed a team of seven engineers.</p>

<p>I have worked extensively with decentralized financial protocols, bringing a unique perspective by combining my extensive corporate experience with IBM, SAP, Deloitte and KPMG with the disruptive financial models being developed on blockchain.</p>

<p>My earlier career focused on enterprise applications, service oriented architectures and cross application business processes. Where I founded a consultancy firm which grew to $800k in revenues and ran from 2000-2009. One of my former clients, EFI ($1.6 billion market cap) brought me on as a Manager in Enterprise Systems Architecture where I remained for 6 years.</p>

<p>I have been passionate about software and technology since high school. I graduated from the University of Queensland with a Bachelor of Science majoring in Computer Science before travelling globally leading the design and development of many Service Oriented Architectures and Blockchain implementations.</p>
