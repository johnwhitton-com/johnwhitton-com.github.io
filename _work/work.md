## Summary

**John is a research engineer, founder and engineering manager.**

John Whiton has been passionate about software and technology since high school. He graduated from the University of Queensland in Computer Science and travelled globally leading the design and development of many Service Oriented Architectures. He has built private permissioned blockchains on Ethereum and Hypersphere Fabric, grew the ecosystem for a public blockchain at Harmony. He has worked extensively with decentralized financial protocols, bringing a unique perspective by combining his extensive corporate experience with IBM, SAP, Deloitte and KPMG with the disruptive financial models being developed on blockchain. He recently has been designing and prototyping multiple defi and layer1 protocols and consulting as a research engineer on Trustless Bridging incorporating knowledge of DeFi, Cryptographic Primitives, Consensus Layer and Zero Knowledge Proofs.

John has over 20 years of experience. An early entrepreneur, he founded his own consultancy firm which he grew to $800k in revenues and ran from 2000-2009. One of his former clients, EFI ($1.6 billion market cap) brought him on as a Manager in Enterprise Systems Architecture where he remained for 6 years. The next stage of John’s career brought him to Blockchain where he was CTO for Loyyal (BaaS company) and an Ecosystem Architect at Harmony. At Harmony, John helped launch the Mainnet while also being intimately involved with hiring decisions and business strategy.

Since April 2020, John has worked as a founder providing strategy, research, design and building out DeFi infrastructure including trustless bridging, web3 identity and wallets, Parachains and Trading Protocols on Polkadot and Solidity Based DeFi applications.

#### Successful Product Launches

5 blockchain launches and multiple ecosystem releases, Gama Space Station NFT Launch, dot-country web3 identity and web2 backend launch.
