<p>John is amazing at explaining and delegating. I’m always impressed with his knowledge base. I think more efforts could be made to capture his knowledge in “explainers”, that would go a long way to supporting the community. John can also run anything, like up and running in a matter of minutes. This means he can troubleshoot tons of deployment issues from the core protocol all the way up to the application layer</p>
