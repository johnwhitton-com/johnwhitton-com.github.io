  <p align="center">Research on Bridging, Zero Knowledge, Consensus, DeFi and NFT's</p>
</div>

This knowledge base and learning center is based upon research I have done recently around bridging, zero knowledge and chain consensus and signing. I have been working lately both independently and collaborating with other individuals and organizations.  

**Specifically I'd like to thank**

* [Aaron Li](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aaronqli/): who has mentored and driven much of the research aaround cryptographic primitives, wallets, gaming and trustless bridging.
* [The Delendum Team](https://delendum.xyz/team): who are leading many zero knowledge research initiatives.
* [Ganesha Upadhyaya](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gupadhyaya/): For his leading work on the horizon bridge and other trustless bridging research.
* [Rongjian Lan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rongjianlan/): For his work on core protocol, specifically Harmony and the knowledge which he shared.
